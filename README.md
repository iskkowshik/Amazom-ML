Text Extraction from Images – Amazon Hackathon
Overview
Text extraction from images plays a crucial role in automating data retrieval from product labels, invoices, scanned documents, and more. This project focuses on efficient and scalable OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques to extract and process text from images. By leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and cloud-based services, this solution ensures high accuracy and adaptability for real-world applications.

This project is built as part of the Amazon Hackathon to develop an AI-powered system that streamlines text extraction, making it fast, reliable, and scalable for various industries, including e-commerce, logistics, finance, and healthcare.

Problem Statement
Many industries rely on manually extracting text from images, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. Traditional OCR tools often struggle with low-quality images, different fonts, handwritten text, and complex layouts. This project aims to automate and optimize text extraction by integrating advanced image processing, AI-powered OCR, and cloud computing solutions.

Features
Automated text extraction from different image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
Preprocessing techniques (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, thresholding) to improve accuracy
OCR engine selection between Tesseract OCR and AWS Textract for best results
Structured output formats (JSON, CSV) for seamless data integration
REST API integration for easy deployment and scalability
Support for multi-language text recognition
Cloud storage for storing processed images and extracted text
Batch processing support for handling multiple images efficiently
Use Cases
E-commerce: Extract product details from labels and receipts
Healthcare: Digitize patient records from scanned prescriptions
Banking & Finance: Process invoices, checks, and financial documents
Logistics: Extract shipment details from scanned documents
Government & Legal: Digitize legal contracts and forms
Tech Stack
Backend
